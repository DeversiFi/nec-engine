# Nectar Burn Engine

This repository contains a smart-contract auction engine for burning Nectar tokens.

The DeversiFi exchange will contribute some of its fee revenues to this engine, allowing part of the Nectar token supply to be permanently destroyed, reducing circulating supply and increasing scarcity.
